GZ2 data release paper
Getting to the issues I skipped the first time.
Apr 17, 2013

- Most people are OK with a data release paper only
- Section 5 can be trimmed down somewhat
- Check on the actual data and debiasing w/Brooke

lots of debate on flags: consensus was to include thresholds/vote limits for flags USED TO DEFINE THE CORRECTION, but maybe not as an endorsed clean sample. 

At end of all the comparison sections: put a recommendation for cutoffs, if possible.

Jordan Raddick

- add table with minimum thresholds and vote counts per task
- Suggestion: add section 4.4 with example cases on using data

Lucy Fortson

- check calculations in Eqns. 4-15; Eqns 13-15 look inverted.

Mike Williams

- check the figures on threshold and clean criterion (agreed)

Karen Masters

- early-type = E/S0/S0a, late-type = Sab and later?
- Absolute magnitude limit: -20.94 (KLM) vs -20.89 (KWW)?
- will make a p_bar plot for Hoyle comparisons to EFIGI

Tom Melvin

- suggests that we offer users an example of how to extract given objects (or alternatively, how to use likelihoods to do population studies)

Ramin Skibba

- bulge-disk composition? Simard et al, Lackner & Gunn

Brooke Simmons

- does the fact that adjustment doesn't work between 0.085 and 0.25 say anything about the expected timescales for galaxy evolution? really good question.
- how well does a linear fit work for Tasks 01 and 07?
- do the differences between coadd1 and coadd2 data change as a function of apparent magnitude and/or surface brightness?
- science part: plot SSFR vs. the bulge prominence?

Steven Bamford

- check luminosity range for barred galaxies compared to Masters at end of Sec. 3
- Has (legitimate) concerns about flags.

- check galaxies with NA10 no-bar, GZ2 yes. Are they actually barred?
- are "dominant" bulges ellipticals with tidal tails?

Kevin Casteels

- offered to write a short section on angular separation bias. Welcome!
- another section in 5.2.3
- include table of thresholds used in previously published GZ2 papers?

Chris Lintott

- example images of the two sets of coadd images?
- how many galaxies changed classifications for multiple? Ask SB. 
- how was convergence tested for consistency?
- shorten NA10 bar section; summarize Masters results in 1 paragraph.
- It would be potentially useful to try combining the winding arms classifications to improve the NA10 40\% false positive rate; for example, by seeing if a high value for loose fraction + a low value for a tight fraction increased the fraction of Sc and Sd galaxies in the highest bins.
