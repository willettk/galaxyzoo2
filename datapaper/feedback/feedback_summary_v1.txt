GZ2 data release paper
Summary of changes from first round of feedback
Mar 14, 2013

Global themes:

- I have done a lot of work
- Looks pretty good so far
- Most people are OK with a data release paper only
- Some votes for including more descriptions of past GZ2 science
- Tighten up vocabulary and descriptions
- Section 5 can be trimmed down somewhat
- Check on the actual data and debiasing w/Brooke
- improved the T-type mapping using a better linear combo. No input at all from the arms winding categories - interesting!

- KW, KLM, TM, CL, SB, LF, BS
lots of debate on flags: consensus was to include thresholds/vote limits for flags USED TO DEFINE THE CORRECTION, but maybe not as an endorsed clean sample. 
get Chris a version for commenting over the weekend

global s/r on:

	coadded or co-added
	questions/tasks
	answers/responses
	British-ise colour, center, etc.


Kevin Schawinski

- missing Kevin's even-numbered pages, but he no longer has the original hardcopy
- supports not including the matched SDSS metadata as a table

Jordan Raddick

- should we mention CSA/Zooniverse anywhere?
- does the color-stretch in Section 2.2 apply to coadd1, coadd2, or both?
- questions on Section 3.2 - ask SB. Especially good point on consistency: why does agreeing with the majority imply that users are correct?
- everyone's doing a good job of catching my demonstrative pronouns
- how to justify Equation 5?
- add table with minimum thresholds and vote counts per task
- online or Appendix version of Fig. 4, with baseline morphology ratios for all response pairs?
- raises the issue of 50% thresholds
- What should users do about the rare objects with high variance in Stripe 82?
- How do differences in coadded data affect use by potential users?
- Suggestion: add section 4.4 with example cases on using data

Lucy Fortson

- disagree on date formatting; ISO-8601 is the gold standard.
- why was coadd1 removed from the site at 18 votes? Preference for coadd2 with better noise characteristics?
- what do the dashed lines mean in Figure 2 (consistency)?
- check calculations in Eqns. 4-15; Eqns 13-15 look inverted.

Mike Williams

- check the figures on threshold and clean criterion (agreed)

Karen Masters

- no science is OK by her; support writing a short science paper ASAP
- be careful when referring to NA10 or EFIGI as "truth"
- early-type = E/S0/S0a, late-type = Sab and later?
- Absolute magnitude limit: -20.94 (KLM) vs -20.89 (KWW)?
- bigger section comparing S82 single-depth and coadd
- will make a p_bar plot for Hoyle comparisons to EFIGI
- f_x -> v_X; vote fractions vs. fraction of galaxies with characteristic?

Tom Melvin

- very reasonable point that Figure 3 needs a legend. Not sure where to put it!
- contrary viewpoint on GZ1 vs. GZ2 classification
- suggests that we offer users an example of how to extract given objects (or alternatively, how to use likelihoods to do population studies)

Ramin Skibba

- suggests shortening Section 5, specifically the NA10 comparisons (reasonable)
- respond on Voronoi tessellation question
- "noticeable bulge" in Fig. 6 has more scatter because of the strong covariance(?) between the just noticeable and obvious questions. These overwhelmingly dominate the bulge prominence question, and are a general effect of the fact that this question really represents more of a continuum (relative strength) rather than a dichotomy.
- bulge-disk composition? Simard et al, Lackner & Gunn
- number of clean ellipticals vs. spirals in GZ1: genuine distribution of galaxies in the local universe?
- yes: need to add a complete Casteels et al. section
- thicken lines in IDL histogram plots (Figs 10-13)

Sugata Kaviraj

- suggests more GZ1 results
- references to the early/late type classifications of MOSES

Brooke Simmons

- histogram of the number of classifications per galaxy for the main sample?
- add more columns to Table 2? Subscript text, answer number
- increase font size of Figure 3, add task numbers
- does the fact that adjustment doesn't work between 0.085 and 0.25 say anything about the expected timescales for galaxy evolution? really good question.
- change text on min. number of classifications, depending on new debiasing results
- agree on subscript order for Eqns. 17-19; only done because it matches Steven's order
- how well does a linear fit work for Tasks 01 and 07?
- Figure 4: move legend to empty panel, bigger labels and add task numbers
- do the differences between coadd1 and coadd2 data change as a function of apparent magnitude and/or surface brightness?
- look at samples of galaxies for which GZ1 and GZ2 imaging disagrees. What's going on?
- offer to look into GZ1 vs. GZ2 more carefully. Thanks!
- good suggestion on gendered language
- like the N-word remark
- science part: plot SSFR vs. the bulge prominence?

Steven Bamford

- suggests changes in the paragraph that Edd provided on image creation; not sure which to use.
- clarify Equation 4 - what does barred kappa mean?
- check luminosity range for barred galaxies compared to Masters at end of Sec. 3
- Steven has (legitimate) concerns about flags.
- concerned about S82 corrections applied from main sample!
- change Figure 5 to start at z=0.01. Argument for not thresholding?

- check galaxies with NA10 no-bar, GZ2 yes. Are they actually barred?
- not clear on comment about comparing ansae/peanuts to the NA no-bar histogram
- rewrite text in NA10 merger section. Prefer to use vote fractions vs. total number of votes, or multiply by previous cut!
- for Figure 11 (NA10 rings), try f_odd * fring?
- explain in all NA10 sections that we put a vote fraction + vote limit on previous questions.
- are "dominant" bulges ellipticals with tidal tails?

Kevin Casteels

- offered to write a short section on angular separation bias. Welcome!
- another section in 5.2.3
- include table of thresholds used in previously published GZ2 papers?
