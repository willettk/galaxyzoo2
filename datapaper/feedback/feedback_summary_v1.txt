GZ2 data release paper
Summary of changes from first round of feedback
Mar 14, 2013

Global themes:

- I have done a lot of work
- Looks pretty good so far
- Most people are OK with a data release paper only
- Some votes for including more descriptions of past GZ2 science
- Tighten up vocabulary and descriptions
- Section 5 can be trimmed down somewhat
- Check on the actual data and debiasing w/Brooke
- no feedback from Steven or Chris yet.

Kevin Schawinski

- missing Kevin's even-numbered pages, but he no longer has the original hardcopy
- supports not including the matched SDSS metadata as a table

Jordan Raddick

- should we mention CSA/Zooniverse anywhere?
- does the color-stretch in Section 2.2 apply to coadd1, coadd2, or both?
- questions on Section 3.2 - ask SB. Especially good point on consistency: why does agreeing with the majority imply that users are correct?
- everyone's doing a good job of catching my demonstrative pronouns
- how to justify Equation 5?
- add table with minimum thresholds and vote counts per task
- online or Appendix version of Fig. 4, with baseline morphology ratios for all response pairs?
- raises the issue of 50% thresholds
- What should users do about the rare objects with high variance in Stripe 82?
- How do differences in coadded data affect use by potential users?
- Suggestion: add section 4.4 with example cases on using data
