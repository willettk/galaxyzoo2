Code for data reduction and analysis of Galaxy Zoo 2. Currently intended for exclusive use by
the Galaxy Zoo science team. 

The draft of the data release paper (gz2datarelease.pdf), along with associated files, is in the gz2dropbox/ folder. 
This folder also includes the gallery of examples from GZ2 (gz2\_gallery.pdf). 

Code used for data reduction is stored in idl/ and python/.

The final catalog products are stored in the tables/ directory. Tables 3-5 (which match their numbering in the paper)
are stored as zipped CSV, FITS, and VOTable files. Let me know if there are other formats we'd advocate
as being of potential use. 

I update this repo regularly, but please feel free to fork and to send pull requests if you have a GitHub account. 
Email me if you have any questions!
