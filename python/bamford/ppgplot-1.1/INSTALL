If you have Numeric for python and PGPLOT installed, and the PGPLOT_DIR 
environmental variable pointing to the directory containing the 
libpgplot.a and libcpgplot.a files, it should be possible to install 
ppgplot with 1 line:
 # python setup.py install
If the pgplot libraries are in some other directory, or you don't feel 
like setting the PGPLOT_DIR, try this:
 # python setup.py build_ext -L/usr/local/pgplot
 # python setup.py install

Assuming /usr/local/pgplot is the directory where PGPLOT is installed.

Have fun ! :)
